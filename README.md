# Probability-and-Statistics-in-Data-Science-using-Python

This course will introduce more data science skills that prepare you for the next two courses in the MicroMasters: DSE220x-Machine Learning Fundamentals, and DSE230X-Big Data Analytics using Spark.

Overview
The course will cover the following topics:

Overview of sets
Counting principles
Combinatorics 
Discrete probability
Conditional probability and Bayesâ€™ Rule
Random variables, expectation, variance, and correlation
Common distribution families
Continuous distributions
Probabilistic inequalities, concentration, and limit theorems
Regression
Sampling, parameter estimation, and confidence intervals
Hypothesis testing
Learning Objectives
The course will teach you how to visualize, understand, and reason about probabilistic and statistical concepts, and how to apply your knowledge to analyze data sets and draw meaningful conclusions from data. We will cover both theoretical and practical aspects, and will start each topic with motivation and intuition and will proceed with rigorous arguments and provable techniques. Each topic will be accompanied by a Python Notebook that you could run and modify to experiment with the material learned and get a better feel for the material covered.
